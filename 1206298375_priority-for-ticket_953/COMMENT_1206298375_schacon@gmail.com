i think a priority number might be useful for ranking open or hold stories, as an alternative to milestones.  I don't want to attach hard dates to groups of features/bugs, but I would like to rank them by how important I think they are.  You could do that with tags, possibly, but I think a priority system might be cleaner - just a 1-5 deal
